We are grateful for the opportunity to refine our manuscript based on your valuable suggestions. We have diligently worked on and prepared a revised version of the manuscript, which we believe effectively addresses the concerns raised by reviewers and enhances the overall quality and clarity of the presentation. The improvements made in the revised manuscript include:

A. Writing and Presentation Enhancements: We have thoroughly proofread the manuscript to correct any writing errors and have made efforts to enhance the overall presentation.

B. Addressing Specific Concerns: Each issue raised by reviewers has been carefully considered and addressed in the revised manuscript.

C. Further Improvements: Due to current time constraints, we plan to further refine the manuscript by: 1) Conducting in-depth theoretical analysis and experimental validation on the temporal optimization issues of existing direct training methods. 2) Conducting more comprehensive theoretical analysis and experimental validation on the necessity and effectiveness of heterogeneous training strategies based on the intrinsic temporal characteristics of SNN. 3) Validating TPL on a broader range of time-related datasets, such as speech datasets. Analyzing the training and computational costs, as well as the convergence speed of TPL, to verify the applicability of this method in practical application scenarios.
